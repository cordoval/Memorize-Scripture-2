This is my first project

#Memorize Scripture: Is meant to be a project to enable memorization with the method called "Extended Memorization".

##TODO:

###5. Current task:

    - now we are integrating adminbundle we are trying to read rst files 3
    - a lot of time has elapsed
	- now trying to get the twig template to display sample SessionVerses entries
	- just tested phpstorm for 30 days started today 1 April
	- fixed template for Tracker controller
	- we will leave association from verse to chapter to book to bible for later
	- fixed associations missing @orm for entities SessionVerse and Verse
	- fixed my git setup because of sparkleshare
	- did some modifications to the model
	- changing name from old "Recitee" to SessionVerse	
	- working on dql query on SessionVerseRepository.php - there has to be relationships
	- have created entity for SessionVerse
	- added routing to local configuration
	- have added Tracker Controller file
	- have added Tracker Controller test file



###4. Transforming the specification of use into an specification for the platform

	Here is spec of use:

		1. write a verse you intend to memorize on the first line of the "week" page
		2. memorize it and recite it, and check box closest in line to it
		3. 6 boxes per week, recite and check, each box is a day, R is for rest
		4. recite 6 days a week for 6 weeks (36 times)
			The most you can be memorizing at one time is six verses on any given week
		5. extending it review 1 time a week 6 months (4 weeks each month) 24 weeks
		   each day at maximum could be 4 verses because at the end of the 24th week we will have at most
		   24 verses 1 coming in each week, so a total of 24 verses to repeat on a given week, if we
		   split 4 verses each day across the 6 days on that week then it is easier. Notice that
		   this 4 verses is on top of the 6 verses that we could be reciting a day.

		   Therefore, in total on any given day at maximum one can be reciting 6 + 4 = 10 verses
		   And learning 1 new verse every week for good and sustained increase.
		   In a year there are 52 weeks, which means we can learn 52 new verses every year.
		   If a person invests approximately 40 years on memorization then that person will know
		   how to recite by memory 52 x 40 = 2080 verses for a lifetime.
		   Genesis has 50 chapters and the number of total verses in the book is less than 1600.

		   The number of verses to memorize a day can be increased as a parameter but ideal is 10 a day as above.
		   This is signaled with the elipses in the specs below.

	Here is our spec:

		1. presentation or views proposed

			Logs View

				Display queue of verses already memorized

			Create New SessionVerse

				Select verse: Pull down for Bible, Book, Chapter, Verse

				Schedule date of entrance: dd/mm/yyyy

				Param (how extended?): # of total repetitions
				
			Create SessionVerse Range

				Select verse range: Pull down for Bible, Book, Chapter, Start Verse, End Verse

				Schedule date of entrance: dd/mm/yyyy

				Param (how extended?): # of total repetitions

###3. we thought about going to gitorious however we decided to pull back into github as we should be ok in memory

###2. work on FixtureLoader to load KJV Bible data into database with app/console doctrine:load:data
   - now adapting scrapper into FixtureLoader so we can load at least a chapter of the KJV Bible
   	- have created fixture entry points for bible, book, chapter, and verse
        - have reloaded data into entity tables successfully with app/console doctrine:data:load
	- have integrated scrapper
        - have expanded verse entity to include the text of each verse
	- have successfully loaded all Genesis, however verses are spread out in a single table

###1. create database elements to input the scrap data that we got from KJV
   - have created entities for each of the bible, chapter, verse elements
   - have cleared cache with app/console cache:clear
   - have drop earlier tables with app/console doctrine:schema:drop --force
   - have recrated entity tables / schema with app/console doctrine:schema:create
   - have reloaded data into entity tables with app/console doctrine:data:load
